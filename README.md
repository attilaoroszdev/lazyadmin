# Lazy Admin - a bash cli menu system.

Lazy Admin will draw a pseudo graphical menu on your terminal, or terminal emulator, using nothing but `bash`, and `sed`.

## Why Lazy Admin?

You can think of Lazy Admin as aliases on steroids. Instead of remembering  and typing out long commands, weird script names, and all their parameters, you can store the on a conveniently navigable tabbed menu-like interface.

## What does it do?

* **Arrow-key navigation** - Arrow keys do what you expect them to do
* **List-like menu items** - Each menu item is accessible through navigating a vertical list of items, organized neatly on tabs
* **Tabs for grouping similar items** - Left/Right arrows will switch tabs
* **One liner item descriptions** - When you navigate the menu, a description appears in the bottom row
* **Shortkeys** - Each item is accessible by pressing its corresponding number on the current tab. E.g. to launch the 3rd item, press 3.
* **Sub-menus** - Any menu-item can invoke a sub-menu, which can hold further items
* **Visual command builder with predefined parameters** - Build long commands in an interactive way.
* **Optional side panel** - with predefined items like *Reflow menu*, *Help*, *Key Bindings*, *Back to main* and *Exit*, which can also hold user defined items. Ideal for holding menu items that might apply to all tabs.
* **No dependencies "pure" bash interface** - ideal for managing servers via SSH.
* **Easy set-up** - The installer script is completely platform independent. Settings can be changed by editing simple text files, from within the UI. Script aliases bind scripts to menu items by position, and a user script "repository" file is also available.

### Yeak ok, but why *Lazy* Admin?

Because it's meant for sysadmins, who are lazy. Lazy to type, lazy to remember, etc.

### Does it make sense?

Probably not a lot, but it's fun. Although if you have mundane and/or repetative tasks to run on remote servers via SSH, it can be rather helpful.

## Installing Lazy Admin

Installation is pretty straightforward. Download the latest release, and unpack the tarball. It should either contain an `install.sh` script, or a launcher, ready to go (in the portable variety). If you go the installer way the should also be another tarball, corresponding to the release's version number. Keep these in the same directory and run the script. There are a few options, to choose form, but these will be explained as you go along.

### Upgrading from a previous version

If you already have Lazy Admin installed, and want to upgrade, you can just run the installer as you normally would. It will ask you if you want to purge your previous user configurations. If you say no, you will keep them and the new version will automatically use your defined menus and functions. if you say yes, it will still keep the old configs, in case you'd change your mind.

## So how can I configure it?

For a detailed guide of configuration and usage, you can refer to the help files within the package, accessible directly via the help menu in either MarkDown or plain text format. (Unless you choose the minimal install. in that case, you are on your own, only having the code comments for company... )

To access the help menu, either  navigate to the right panel by pressing 'r' or Ctrl + âžœ, and select *Get Help*, or just press 'h' from anywhere inside Lazy Admin.
