#Main menu functions in the format of funct#tab#menuitem
#First tab is 0, first item is 0
#E.g.
#Fist tab first item is: funct00
#Second tab tird menuitem is: funct12
#
#You could implement your functions right here, but it is probably
#easier and less messy to put them in a separate file, and it will make
#them easier to reuse or reorganise in the menu

# Submenu functions. these will have a similar naming system, except
# they would be extended by submenu position as well, making it subfunctt###

# that is, for e.g. the first tab second menuitem, 3rd submenuitem:
# subfunct012
# for the third tab, first submenu, fifth submenuitem
# subfunct204

    # Here is an example of how to invoke the flag setting submenu
	#
	# Call command_builder_function with the following arguments:
	#
	# $1 - Title of submenu, enclosed in ""
	# $2 - Function to execute
	# $3 to $9 - A list of the flags entered literally
	#
	# Note 0: You could set 10 or more arguments, but the shortkeys
	# (i.e. using the keyboard to add the flags) wil only work up to nine
	# parameters
	#
	# Note 1: You can hard-code items that contain whitespace by placing
	# them in single or doune quotes. (See '-c 3' here) For flexibility
	# it might be better to only hardcode the first part and the optional
	# bit could be entered manually, using the "m - Enter flags manually"
	# functionality. I.e. You could pass -c as an argument, then set the
	# number manually, as in the last argument
	#
	# Note 2: You must literally enter all arguments, along with the
	# adequate number of hyphens (- or --)
	#
	# Note 3: The manual set option can be useful for setting the hostname/any
	# other argumenrt (in that case just take out the "localhost" bit
	# from the original function "flagtets_localhostping in this case)
