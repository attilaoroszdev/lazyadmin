# The actual menu entries. 
# - Tab ID or Tab name are also supported, but Tab ID with number is preferred for clarity
# - "Menu items text" is what is displayed in the menu
# - "Longer description text" is displayed in the footer when selected. If left empty, do not skip the :: sepaator
# - "Fucntion or command to run" is what the item does when selected. This can pre receeded by the following switches:
#    /c clear before running
#    /d delayed return (propmpts for keypress after finish)
#    /v validate before running (cheks if it's a valid function or package name before running
#
# If both description and function name are ommitted, the item becomes a label
# If Menu item is also empty, the position will be skiopped (empty line) (Tab ID still necessary)
# Dividers lines can be drawn like this:
#
# Tab ID :: ---
#
# Submenu items start with --  instead of a Tab ID, and belong to the last "proper" menui item
# Inline comments are NOT supported at this time
