To install
----------

Run ./install.sh, or ./install-min.sh (if you have the minimal edition). In case of portable edition, there is no installer, (or the need for one), just run ./pladmin, or ./pmladmin from Lazy Admin's root fir.


To run
------
    
Run one of the following launchers:

- 'ladmin' - for full edition 
- 'mladmin' - for minimal edition
    
One of these will be placed in etheir $HOME or /opt/Lazy_Admin/, depending on the type of your install. If you agreed to symlink to /src/local/bin, you can also run it as a command

- 'pladmin' - for portable edition
- 'pmladmin' - for portable minimal edition

One of these will be int the Lazy Admin directory, which you have extracetd from the release tarball. You could also symlink it, but then it would oloose its "portable-ness" wouldn't it?



To configure
------------

- Full editions should have detailed documentation included. Access the Help menu for details
- Running a minimal edition? You are on your own. May the code comments guide your script.
