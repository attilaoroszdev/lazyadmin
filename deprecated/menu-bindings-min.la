functionstyle="simple"

# fucntionstyle="simple" (default)
# Main menu functions in the format of tab$item$
# First tab is 1, first item is 1
# E.g.
# Fist tab first item is: tab1item1
# Second tab third menuitem is: tab2item3
#
# Backward compat:
# functionstyle="old"
# Main menu functions in the format of funct#tab#menuitem
# First tab is 0, first item is 0
# E.g.
# Fist tab first item is: funct00
# Second tab tird menuitem is: funct12


 
# You could implement your functions right here, but it is probably
# easier and less messy to put them in a separate file, and it will make
# them easier to reuse or reorganise in the menu

# Submenu functions. These will have a similar naming system, except
# they would be extended by submenu position as well,
#
# fucntionstyle="simple" (default)
# 
# Tab and menuitem are marked (in which submenu we are), 
# then sub-item number follows, starting from 1 like so:
# tab$item$sub$
# E.g.
# First tab, first menu item, first submenuu-item: tab1item1sub1
# Third tab, fourth menu item, second submenu item: tab3item4sub2
#
# Backward compat:
# functionstyle="old"
#
# Similar to main menus, only one digit more, starting from 0, like
# subfunct$$$
# or sunfunct$(tabposition)$(mainmenuposition)$(submenuposition)
#E.g. F
# First tab first menuitem, first submenuitem: subfunct000
# Third tab, fourth menuitem, second submenuitem: subfunct231
# and so on
